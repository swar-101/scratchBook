     *      You have to return the binary array (of length |B|) as the answer where `1` denotes that the word is
     *      present and `0` denotes it is not present.
     *      Formally, for each word in B, you need to return `1` if it's present in the dictionary and `0` if not.
     *      Such problems can be seen in real life when we work on any online editor (like Google Document), if the
     *      word is not valid we underline by a red line.
     *      NOTE : The constraint is to find the solution of O(n) time complexity.
