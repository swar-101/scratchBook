# Greedy Algorithms

A Greedy Algorithm is an approach to solving optimization problems that makes a series of locally optimal choices at each step with the goal of finding a globally optimal solution. In other words, it focuses on making the best possible decision at each stage, hoping that this cumulative sequence of choices leads to an optimal outcome for the entire problem.

Key characteristics and principles of Greedy Algorithms include:

1. Greedy choice property: 
	At each step, the algorithm selects the best available option according to a specific criterion, without considering the consequences of that choice on future steps.

2. Optimal Substructure: 
	The problem can be divided into subproblems, and solving each subproblem optimally contributes to finding the overall optimal solution.

3. No Backtracking:
	Once a decision made, it's final. Greedy Algorithms do not backtrack or reconsider other decisions.

4. Efficiency: 
   Greedy Algorithms are often efficient and run in linear or near-linear time because they make straight-forward choices without considering all possibilities.

5. Applications:
	Greedy Algorithms are commonly used for optimization problems in various domains such as scheduling, graph algorithms, and data compression.

6. Correctness:
	Greedy Algorithms do not guarantee an optimal solution for all problems. Their correctness depends on the problem's structure and whether the Greedy Choice Property leads to an optimal solution. It's essential to prove correctness for each specific problem.


The key challenge in designing and analyzing Greedy Algorithms is ensuring that the chosen criterion for making local decisions aligns with the goal of finding an optimal or near-optimal solution for the entire problem. 
Greedy Algorithms are valuable tools for solving many real-world problems efficiently, but they require careful consideration of the problem's nature and structure.

## Greedy Algorithms: Nature and Structure of the Problem

The nature and structure of the problem that require careful consideration when designing a Greedy Algorithm require several key aspects:

1. Optimization Objective: 
	Greedy Algorithms are most suitable for optimization problems where you want to maximize or minimize certain value.
	It's crucial to clearly define the optimization objective, such as maximizing profit, minimizing cost, or finding the shortest path. 

2. Greedy Choice Property:
	Identifying the criterion or rule for making **'greedy choice'** is critical. This criterion should align with the optimization objective. 
	Careful thought is needed to determine which choice is "locally" optimal in the context of the problem.

3. Subproblem Decomposition:
	Analyzing how the problem can be broken down into subproblems is essential. 
	Greedy Algorithms often work well on the problems that has an **'optimal substructure'**, meaning that solving smaller instances of the problem contributes to solving the larger problem optimally.

4. No Backtracking: 
	Greedy Algorithms do not backtrack or reconsider earlier decisions. 
	It's important to asses whether this limitation is acceptable for the problem at hand. 
	Problems that have certain properties allowing for a sequence of optimal local choices are better suited for Greedy Algorithms.

5. Greedy Choice Independence:
	In some cases, it is necessary to confirm that the choices made at one step do not affect the optimality of the choices made at subsequent steps. 
	Greedy Algorithms work best when choices are made independently.

6. Proving Correctness:
	Before applying a Greedy Algorithm, you must rigorously prove it's correctness for the specific problem. 
	This involves demonstrating that the chosen criterion for making greedy choices indeed leads to an optimal or near-optimal solution.

7. Analysis of Trade-offs:
	Consideration of trade-offs between efficiency of the algorithm and the optimality of the solution is crucial. 
	Greedy Algorithms often provide approximate solutions quickly, but you need to assess whether the approximation is acceptable for the problem's requirements.

8. Problem Constraints:
	Understanding the constraints and limitations of the problem is essential. Some problems may have constraints that make greedy choices challenging or impossible, while others may have favorable properties for Greedy Algorithms.

9. Problem-Specific Insights:
	Problem specific insights and domain knowledge can guide the selection of Greedy Algorithm and the criteria for making greedy choices.


In summary, the nature and structure of the problem that requires careful consideration in the context of Greedy Algorithms include.
- Problem's Optimization objective.
- Subproblem Decomposition.
- The Greedy Choice Criteria. 
- Proving Correctness.
